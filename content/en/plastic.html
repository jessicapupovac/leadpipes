Your pipes are made of plastic

<p>
That’s good. The effect of plastic pipes on health hasn’t been extensively studied, but it’s generally accepted that they’re a good way to go when it comes to plumbing.

There’s still a chance you could have lead fittings or solder somewhere in your plumbing. If you want to check whether there’s lead in your water, try requesting a test. You have a couple options. Some utilities will test your water for free, but <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/02/lead-water-testing-cheats-chicago-boston-philadelphia">not all utilities</a> use sound methods. You can order tests online, too. They also vary in quality, but <a href="https://hbbf.org/test-kits-start">here's one</a>that that we know is reliable. But, remember: lead release is sporadic. So, if there is any lead at all, you might want to consider taking other protective measures.

If you’re concerned, you could also think about getting a water filter <a href="http://info.nsf.org/Certified/DWTU/listings_leadreduction.asp?ProductFunction=053%7CLead+Reduction&ProductFunction=058%7CLead+Reduction&ProductType=&submit2=Search">that is certified</a> for lead removal (it should say “NSF/ANSI Standard 53” on the package).And you can always call up a plumber to check for lead.
