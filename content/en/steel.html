 Your pipes are probably galvanized steel

<p>
That’s good, but not great. If rusty pipes are connected to lead plumbing, <a href="https://www.dcwater.com/waterquality/plumbing/fact_sheet.cfm">they can trap</a> bits of the metal on the inside surface. The steel pipes can periodically release those bits of lead, even after lead plumbing is removed.</p>
<p>
And it’s still possible that you might have some lead fittings or solder in your plumbing. It’s probably a good idea to use a filter <a href="http://info.nsf.org/Certified/DWTU/listings_leadreduction.asp?ProductFunction=053%7CLead+Reduction&ProductFunction=058%7CLead+Reduction&ProductType=&submit2=Search">that is certified</a> to remove lead (it should say “NSF/ANSI Standard 53” on the package). And you can always call up a plumber to check.

If you want to know whether lead is leaching into your water, , try requesting a test. Water samples only provide a snapshot of a potential problem, but some information is better than none. If you decide to test your water, you have a couple options. Some utilities will test your water for free, but <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/02/lead-water-testing-cheats-chicago-boston-philadelphia">not all utilities</a> use sound methods. You can order tests online, too. They also vary in quality, but <a href="https://hbbf.org/test-kits-start">here's one</a>that that we know is reliable.
