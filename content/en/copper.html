<h1>Your pipes are probably made of copper</h1>

<p>
That’s great because they aren’t made of lead – congratulations! But it’s still possible that you might have lead fittings or solder somewhere in the plumbing, especially if it was installed before 1960.

If you want to check whether there’s lead in your water, try requesting a test. Remember, water samples don't provide a complete picture -- only a snapshot of a potential problem. Still, some information is better than none. If you decide to test your water, you have a couple options. Some utilities will test your water for free, but <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/02/lead-water-testing-cheats-chicago-boston-philadelphia">not all utilities</a> use sound methods. You can order tests online, too. They also vary in quality, but <a href="https://hbbf.org/test-kits-start">here's one</a>that that we know is reliable. </p>
<p>You could also think about getting a water filter <a href="http://info.nsf.org/Certified/DWTU/listings_leadreduction.asp?ProductFunction=053%7CLead+Reduction&ProductFunction=058%7CLead+Reduction&ProductType=&submit2=Search">that is certified</a> for lead removal (it should say “NSF/ANSI Standard 53” on the package).  </p>
<p>
And you can always call up a plumber to check for lead. </p>
