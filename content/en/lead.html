<h1>
You’ve got lead pipes
</h1>
<p>
Here’s what you can do:
</p>
<p>
If you want to know how lead might be affecting your water, try requesting a test.You have a couple options. Some utilities will test your water for free, but <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/02/lead-water-testing-cheats-chicago-boston-philadelphia">not all utilities</a> use sound methods. You can order tests online, too. They also vary in quality, but <a href="https://hbbf.org/test-kits-start">here's one</a>that that we know is reliable. But, remember: lead release is sporadic. So, if there is any lead at all, you might want to consider taking other protective measures.
</p>
<p>
Consider replacing your pipes. Call a local plumber to get an estimate. Your water utility might also have recommendations.
</p>
<p>
If that’s not an option, think about getting a water filter <a href="http://info.nsf.org/Certified/DWTU/listings_leadreduction.asp?ProductFunction=053%7CLead+Reduction&ProductFunction=058%7CLead+Reduction&ProductType=&submit2=Search">that is certified</a> for lead removal (it should say “NSF/ANSI Standard 53” on the package). And if it’s been a few hours since you last used a tap in your house, it’s a good idea to let the water run for five minutes before you use it, to flush out any water that’s been sitting in the pipes.
